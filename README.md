# DatabaseAgenda
A simple GUI interface connected to a MySQL database

# About
The project is built based on the MVC architecture. While being connected to a MySQL database, we can add people to our Person table and also add contacts for each 
individual using a Contact table linked to it. People are unique based on their name, meaning we can't add 2 people with the same name. We can also delete people 
from our Person table. More functionalities are coming soon.
